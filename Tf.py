What are the code changes we expect 
ChatGPT said:
The migration from SageMaker Studio Classic to the latest SageMaker Studio experience will require some code changes, primarily due to differences in JupyterLab versions, kernels, environment management, and API updates. Here’s what you can expect:

1. JupyterLab Version & Extension Changes
Classic used JupyterLab 1.x, while the new experience supports JupyterLab 3.x.
Some extensions may no longer work and need replacements.
Any custom JupyterLab configurations (e.g., themes, shortcuts, workspaces) may require manual reconfiguration.
Action Items:

Check existing extensions using:
jupyter labextension list
Reinstall compatible extensions or migrate to alternative solutions.
2. Kernel & Package Management Changes
The latest SageMaker Studio uses Conda for environment management, but it’s integrated with AWS-managed Jupyter environments.
Custom pip-installed dependencies may need adjustments.
Kernel names may change, affecting kernel.json references in .ipynb files.
Action Items:

If your code hardcodes kernel names, update them:
!python -m ipykernel install --user --name my_env --display-name "Python (my_env)"
Check package compatibility and explicitly install missing dependencies.
3. SageMaker SDK Updates
Some SageMaker API functions may have changed or been deprecated.
Example: Older SageMaker training job definitions may need updates in how they define instances or parameters.
Code Example: Old vs. New Training Job Syntax Old (Classic Studio):

from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow
tf_estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='train.py',
                          role=role,
                          train_instance_count=1,  # Deprecated
                          train_instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge')
New (Latest Studio Experience):

from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow
tf_estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='train.py',
                          role=role,
                          instance_count=1,  # Updated parameter
                          instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge')
4. Git Integration Changes
If using Git repositories in Classic, you may need to reconfigure Git settings in the new environment.
The new Studio experience has improved Git integration via SageMaker Studio settings, but any manual .gitconfig settings may need to be re-applied.
Action Items:

Reconfigure Git inside SageMaker Studio:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
Reconnect repositories as needed.
5. SageMaker Notebook Lifecycle Config Changes
If you used Lifecycle Configurations in Classic Studio (e.g., to auto-install packages or set up environments), those scripts may require changes.
The new Studio experience supports different storage and execution models.
Action Items:

Verify existing Lifecycle Configuration scripts and adapt them to the new framework.
6. S3 Data Access Differences
The latest Studio experience may have stricter IAM and VPC settings affecting how notebooks access S3.
If data access via boto3 or sagemaker is restricted, you may need to adjust IAM roles.
Example Code Update for S3 Access:

import boto3
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

# Explicitly specify a region if needed
s3_client.list_buckets()
Final Steps
Test your scripts in the new Studio environment to catch issues early.
Update your migration documentation with any new findings.
Provide users with troubleshooting guidance for common issues.
Are there any specific areas where you expect challenges?






You said:
I have observed most of the changes are in .tf files why?
ChatGPT said:
The reason most changes are in .tf (Terraform) files is that SageMaker Studio infrastructure is managed via AWS resources, and Terraform is used to define and provision these resources. The migration to the latest SageMaker Studio experience involves changes in resource definitions, IAM policies, networking, and domain settings, which are all managed in Terraform.

Why Are Most Changes in .tf Files?
New SageMaker Studio Domain & User Profiles

The latest SageMaker Studio experience requires setting up a new SageMaker Studio domain.
Terraform scripts that previously referenced Studio Classic need updates to provision the new environment.
Example Change:

# Old SageMaker Studio Classic resource (deprecated)
resource "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance" "studio" {
  name          = "my-studio"
  instance_type = "ml.t3.medium"
  role_arn      = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_role.arn
}
# New SageMaker Studio Experience
resource "aws_sagemaker_domain" "studio" {
  domain_name     = "my-new-studio"
  auth_mode       = "IAM"
  vpc_id          = aws_vpc.main.id
  subnet_ids      = [aws_subnet.subnet1.id, aws_subnet.subnet2.id]
  default_user_settings {
    execution_role = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_role.arn
  }
}
IAM Role & Permission Updates

Studio Classic had different IAM role requirements.
The new Studio experience may require additional permissions for the SageMaker Domain and User Profiles.
Example IAM Policy Change:

# Old IAM Role for Classic Studio
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "sagemaker_policy" {
  role = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_role.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = ["sagemaker:CreateNotebookInstance"]
        Effect = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
# Updated IAM Role for Latest Studio Experience
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "sagemaker_policy" {
  role = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_role.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "sagemaker:CreateDomain",
          "sagemaker:CreateUserProfile",
          "sagemaker:StartStudioApp"
        ]
        Effect = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
Networking & VPC Adjustments

The new SageMaker Studio experience may require subnet updates, security group changes, or VPC endpoints for better S3 access and private connectivity.
Terraform files defining VPC, subnets, and security groups need updates.
Example Change in Networking Configuration:

# Old Security Group for Classic Studio
resource "aws_security_group" "studio_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
# Updated Security Group for New Studio
resource "aws_security_group" "studio_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [aws_vpc.main.cidr_block]
  }
}
SageMaker App & Kernel Configuration Changes

The new Studio experience supports JupyterLab 3.x, affecting how apps and kernels are configured.
Terraform resources for notebook instances or Jupyter kernels may need updates.
Example Change:

# Old Notebook Instance in Classic Studio
resource "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance" "old_notebook" {
  name          = "old-notebook"
  instance_type = "ml.t3.medium"
  role_arn      = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_role.arn
}
# New SageMaker App in Latest Studio
resource "aws_sagemaker_app" "new_app" {
  domain_id       = aws_sagemaker_domain.studio.id
  app_name        = "notebook"
  app_type        = "JupyterServer"
  user_profile_name = "user1"
}
What Should You Do?
Compare Old and New Terraform Resources

Identify deprecated resources and update them accordingly.
Verify IAM roles, VPC settings, and SageMaker resource definitions.
Run a Terraform Plan (terraform plan)

This will show all changes before applying them.
Apply Changes in Stages (terraform apply)

Migrate IAM roles, networking, and SageMaker resources step by step.
Validate SageMaker Studio Access

Ensure users can access the new SageMaker Studio environment.
Confirm that Git, Jupyter kernels, and permissions are working.
Since most changes are Terraform-based, is there a specific issue you’re facing in applying the .tf updates?
