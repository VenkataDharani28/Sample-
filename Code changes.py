Studio Classic is no longer supported by AWS and we need to move to the latest SageMaker Studio experience.
ChatGPT said:
Yes, AWS has deprecated SageMaker Studio Classic, and transitioning to the latest SageMaker Studio experience is necessary. Since you're coordinating this migration, here are some key points to ensure a smooth transition:

1. Understand Key Differences
The latest SageMaker Studio experience offers an improved UI, better integration with SageMaker JumpStart, Pipelines, and Model Registry, and enhanced security and access control.
It removes support for Jupyter Lab 1 but supports JupyterLab 3, with enhanced extensions and debugging capabilities.
2. Migration Planning Steps
Assess Current Usage

Identify user groups relying on SageMaker Studio Classic.
Document their workflows, dependencies, and customizations.
Backup and Export Data

Ensure notebooks, datasets, and environment configurations are backed up.
Export Conda environments or dependency lists.
Provision the Latest SageMaker Studio

Set up Domain and User Profiles in the new Studio experience.
Define IAM roles and permissions.
Migrate Custom Jupyter Lab Extensions & Settings

Since you're documenting Jupyter Lab customizations, ensure compatibility with JupyterLab 3.
Validate essential extensions and replace deprecated ones.
Test & Validate

Conduct a pilot migration with select users.
Validate performance, dependencies, and integrations with S3, CodeCommit, GitHub, and other services.
User Training & Documentation

Provide users with guides and training on the new interface.
Update the wiki documentation with migration steps, troubleshooting tips, and new feature highlights.
3. Post-Migration Support
Monitor usage and address user feedback.
Set up a help channel for migration-related questions.
Schedule regular check-ins to resolve issues.
Are there any specific challenges you've encountered in the migration so far?

What are the code changes we expect 
ChatGPT said:
The migration from SageMaker Studio Classic to the latest SageMaker Studio experience will require some code changes, primarily due to differences in JupyterLab versions, kernels, environment management, and API updates. Here’s what you can expect:

1. JupyterLab Version & Extension Changes
Classic used JupyterLab 1.x, while the new experience supports JupyterLab 3.x.
Some extensions may no longer work and need replacements.
Any custom JupyterLab configurations (e.g., themes, shortcuts, workspaces) may require manual reconfiguration.
Action Items:

Check existing extensions using:
jupyter labextension list
Reinstall compatible extensions or migrate to alternative solutions.
2. Kernel & Package Management Changes
The latest SageMaker Studio uses Conda for environment management, but it’s integrated with AWS-managed Jupyter environments.
Custom pip-installed dependencies may need adjustments.
Kernel names may change, affecting kernel.json references in .ipynb files.
Action Items:

If your code hardcodes kernel names, update them:
!python -m ipykernel install --user --name my_env --display-name "Python (my_env)"
Check package compatibility and explicitly install missing dependencies.
3. SageMaker SDK Updates
Some SageMaker API functions may have changed or been deprecated.
Example: Older SageMaker training job definitions may need updates in how they define instances or parameters.
Code Example: Old vs. New Training Job Syntax Old (Classic Studio):

from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow
tf_estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='train.py',
                          role=role,
                          train_instance_count=1,  # Deprecated
                          train_instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge')
New (Latest Studio Experience):

from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow
tf_estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='train.py',
                          role=role,
                          instance_count=1,  # Updated parameter
                          instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge')
4. Git Integration Changes
If using Git repositories in Classic, you may need to reconfigure Git settings in the new environment.
The new Studio experience has improved Git integration via SageMaker Studio settings, but any manual .gitconfig settings may need to be re-applied.
Action Items:

Reconfigure Git inside SageMaker Studio:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
Reconnect repositories as needed.
5. SageMaker Notebook Lifecycle Config Changes
If you used Lifecycle Configurations in Classic Studio (e.g., to auto-install packages or set up environments), those scripts may require changes.
The new Studio experience supports different storage and execution models.
Action Items:

Verify existing Lifecycle Configuration scripts and adapt them to the new framework.
6. S3 Data Access Differences
The latest Studio experience may have stricter IAM and VPC settings affecting how notebooks access S3.
If data access via boto3 or sagemaker is restricted, you may need to adjust IAM roles.
Example Code Update for S3 Access:

import boto3
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

# Explicitly specify a region if needed
s3_client.list_buckets()
Final Steps
Test your scripts in the new Studio environment to catch issues early.
Update your migration documentation with any new findings.
Provide users with troubleshooting guidance for common issues.
Are there any specific areas where you expect challenges?
