Here's a structured approach for your documentation:

Migration to the Latest SageMaker Studio Experience
Expected User Experience Changes
General Changes
New UI & Navigation – The latest SageMaker Studio has a redesigned interface with improved usability and performance.
Kernel Gateway Changes – The new version changes how kernels and compute instances are managed, impacting how users start/stop sessions.
Improved Git Integration – Users can now work with Git repositories more efficiently, including better branching and conflict resolution.
IAM Role & Permissions Updates – More granular control over access and permissions within SageMaker Studio.
No Support for Jupyter Notebook Classic – The latest version moves entirely to JupyterLab-based notebooks.
New Image & Kernel Management System – Custom images and kernel configurations will need to be migrated.
Enhanced Performance & Stability – Faster startup times, fewer kernel crashes, and improved resource management.
Pros
✅ Better UI/UX – Easier navigation and improved usability.
✅ Faster Performance – Optimized session startup and reduced latency.
✅ Stronger Git Integration – More seamless version control workflows.
✅ More Flexible Compute Options – Easier access to on-demand compute resources.
✅ Enhanced Security & Compliance – More IAM controls and fine-grained permissions.
✅ Future-Proofed – New features and AWS updates will only be available in the latest experience.

Cons
❌ Learning Curve – Users accustomed to the old UI will need to adapt.
❌ Breaking Changes – Some scripts, kernel images, or workflows may need to be updated.
❌ Loss of Classic Jupyter Interface – Users must transition to JupyterLab-based workflows.
❌ Potential IAM Role Adjustments – Some permissions may require reconfiguration.

Deployment Plan
1. Pre-Migration Preparations
 Identify affected users and notify them about the changes.
 Review existing notebooks, images, and configurations to determine what needs migration.
 Test the latest SageMaker Studio experience in a sandbox environment.
 Update IAM roles and permissions as needed.
2. Migration Execution
 Deploy the latest SageMaker Studio environment.
 Migrate custom images and kernels.
 Test key workflows (e.g., training, deployment, monitoring).
 Validate Git integration and other essential plugins.
3. Post-Migration Support
 Provide documentation and training for users.
 Offer office hours or a support channel for troubleshooting.
 Monitor feedback and optimize configurations as needed.

This Terraform code defines the infrastructure for provisioning a SageMaker domain, user profiles, and applications within AWS. Since AWS has deprecated SageMaker Studio Classic, adjustments may be needed to ensure compatibility with the latest SageMaker Studio experience.

Key Considerations for Migration
Domain & User Profiles

The module "sagemaker_domain" and module "sagemaker_looped_users" provisions the SageMaker domain and user profiles.
Verify that terraform-aws-sagemaker-domain (version 4.0.4) and terraform-aws-sagemaker-userprofile (version 2.5.3) support the latest SageMaker Studio experience.
Networking Changes

Ensure that subnets and VPC configurations are compatible with the new networking requirements of SageMaker Studio.
The latest experience may have different constraints on networking/security group configurations.
Application Changes

The module "sagemaker_app" manages SageMaker apps, including Jupyter notebooks.
Ensure that terraform-aws-sagemaker-app (version 1.0.1) supports launching applications in the new SageMaker Studio.
Image Compatibility

The image_arn attribute specifies custom container images for SageMaker apps.
Verify that existing images are compatible with the new experience or update them if necessary.
IAM & Security Adjustments

The new SageMaker Studio experience may require updates to IAM roles and permissions, particularly around execution policies.
Next Steps
Upgrade Terraform Modules: Confirm whether the module versions need updates to support the latest SageMaker Studio.
Validate IAM Roles: Review policies for necessary adjustments.
Test in a Sandbox: Deploy a test environment to ensure everything works as expected.
Would you like me to draft a step-by-step migration checklist for this Terraform configuration?

SageMaker Studio Migration Checklist (Terraform-Based Deployment)
This checklist will guide you through migrating from SageMaker Studio Classic to the latest SageMaker Studio experience while ensuring compatibility with your existing Terraform-based deployment.

1. Pre-Migration Preparation
✅ Identify Stakeholders

Notify all SageMaker users about the upcoming migration.
Gather feedback on existing pain points and desired improvements.
✅ Assess Current Terraform Configuration

Review Terraform module versions used:
terraform-aws-sagemaker-domain (4.0.4)
terraform-aws-sagemaker-userprofile (2.5.3)
terraform-aws-sagemaker-app (1.0.1)
Confirm if these versions support the latest SageMaker Studio experience.
✅ Backup Existing SageMaker Resources

Export a list of current SageMaker domains, user profiles, and apps.
Back up important notebooks, datasets, and configurations from S3 buckets.
Capture IAM policies and roles used for SageMaker.
✅ Validate IAM & Security Changes

Review and update IAM roles:
Ensure new permissions required for the latest SageMaker Studio are included.
Check if existing execution roles and policies are still valid.
✅ Evaluate Networking Requirements

Confirm that VPC, subnets, and security groups meet the latest SageMaker networking requirements.
Ensure subnets allow access to required AWS services.
2. Migration Execution
✅ Update Terraform Modules

Upgrade SageMaker Terraform modules to their latest versions (if available).
Review module documentation for any required variable or configuration changes.
✅ Deploy New SageMaker Domain

Update module "sagemaker_domain" to provision the latest SageMaker Studio experience.
Deploy the updated Terraform configuration in a sandbox environment first.
Validate that the new SageMaker domain launches successfully.
✅ Migrate User Profiles

Ensure module "sagemaker_looped_users" correctly provisions user profiles in the new experience.
Test user login and session creation.
✅ Validate SageMaker Apps & Custom Images

Verify that module "sagemaker_app" can successfully deploy applications.
Ensure that custom images specified in image_arn are compatible with the latest SageMaker experience.
If needed, rebuild images with updated dependencies.
✅ Update CI/CD Pipeline Variables

Confirm that GitLab CI/CD environment variables align with any new Terraform module requirements.
Update .gitlab-ci.yml if needed.
✅ Perform User Testing

Have a test group of users validate the new SageMaker Studio environment.
Collect feedback on UI, kernel performance, and Git integration.
3. Post-Migration Validation & Support
✅ Monitor Performance & Issues

Track logs and errors from the new SageMaker Studio deployment.
Review SageMaker CloudWatch metrics for anomalies.
✅ Provide User Training & Documentation

Update internal documentation to reflect new features and workflows.
Conduct training sessions for users unfamiliar with the new UI.
✅ Deprecate SageMaker Studio Classic

Once the migration is stable, decommission the old SageMaker Studio Classic environment.
✅ Ongoing Maintenance

Regularly check for SageMaker Studio updates.
Keep Terraform modules updated to maintain compatibility with AWS changes.
