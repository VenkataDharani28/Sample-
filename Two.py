It sounds like you’re outlining key points for the SageMaker Studio migration. Here’s a structured draft you can refine:

Migration to the Latest SageMaker Studio Experience
Background
AWS has officially ended support for SageMaker Studio Classic, requiring a migration to the latest SageMaker Studio Experience. This document outlines the necessary steps, expected changes, and the impact on users.

Changes to SageMaker Discovery Repository
Review and update all dependencies to ensure compatibility with the latest Studio version.
Validate execution of existing notebooks, scripts, and workflows.
Ensure integration with other AWS services remains functional.
Evaluation of Module Versions
Assess and upgrade libraries such as boto3, sagemaker, pandas, numpy, and others.
Verify compatibility with new Studio kernels and images.
Identify and address deprecated APIs or unsupported configurations.
Other Required Code Changes
Update authentication and access control settings if needed.
Adjust infrastructure provisioning scripts (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform, or CDK) for new Studio configurations.
Ensure SageMaker Projects and Pipelines remain functional post-migration.
Modify IAM policies, if necessary, to align with updated Studio permissions.
Expected User Experience Changes
UI Improvements: More streamlined navigation, better integration with AWS services.
Performance Enhancements: Faster instance start times and improved stability.
Kernel & Image Management: Users will interact differently with Jupyter environments and compute resources.
Settings & Customization: Some settings from Studio Classic may not carry over directly.
General Changes
New IAM Role Requirements: Adjustments in permission models.
Improved Git Integration: Better support for repositories.
SageMaker JumpStart: Enhanced access to pre-built ML solutions.
Pros
✔ Enhanced Performance & Stability
✔ Improved Developer Experience
✔ Better Integration with AWS Ecosystem
✔ Long-term AWS Support & Updates

Cons
✖ Learning Curve for Users Migrating from Classic
✖ Potential Compatibility Issues with Custom Configurations
✖ Time & Effort Required for Migration and Validation

Would you like me to expand on any section or include specific migration steps?

Here are some key questions you can raise to the EDAP team regarding the migration to the latest SageMaker Studio Experience:

1. Infrastructure & Access
Will there be any network/VPC-related changes that might impact SageMaker Studio access?
Are there any new IAM role requirements for users or service accounts?
How will authentication (SSO, AWS IAM Identity Center, etc.) be handled post-migration?
2. Compatibility & Dependencies
Are there any known issues with existing SageMaker configurations (e.g., Studio Launch App, AutoML, Pipelines)?
Does the latest Studio Experience support all existing module versions, or should we expect upgrades?
Will custom images and kernels work as-is, or do they require modifications?
3. Data & Storage Management
Are there any changes in how EFS storage is mounted and accessed within Studio?
Will existing S3 bucket permissions and data access policies remain unchanged?
How will user-specific settings and data be migrated (e.g., JupyterLab extensions, environment variables)?
4. Code & Workflow Adjustments
Are there any breaking changes in the execution of SageMaker Pipelines, Training Jobs, or Batch Transform?
Will existing notebook files (stored in EFS or Git repositories) require any modifications?
Are there changes in the way Git repositories are managed within Studio?
5. Performance & Stability
Are there benchmarks comparing the performance of Classic vs. Latest Studio?
Have there been any reported stability issues with the latest Studio version?
Will the migration impact instance startup time or compute resource availability?
6. Timeline & Support
What is the expected timeline for the migration and any associated downtime?
Will there be a rollback plan if issues arise post-migration?
Is there an EDAP support contact or AWS liaison for troubleshooting post-migration issues?
