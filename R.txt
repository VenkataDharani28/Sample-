prepare the create table, Insert queries that you might want to use for testing. I will try to create the table in the EZ tomorrow. 

Also create the queries for each of the ML functions based on the data/table you create. 

Basically have the table data to create and all queries ready. We will test it out and finish the documentation. You both will not get access, so no use waiting

Have this prepared and ready. Today evening we will do it over call. Ill create the table and we will manually try out the ML functions inside EZ
