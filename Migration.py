Yes, AWS has deprecated SageMaker Studio Classic, and transitioning to the latest SageMaker Studio experience is necessary. Since you're coordinating this migration, here are some key points to ensure a smooth transition:

1. Understand Key Differences
The latest SageMaker Studio experience offers an improved UI, better integration with SageMaker JumpStart, Pipelines, and Model Registry, and enhanced security and access control.
It removes support for Jupyter Lab 1 but supports JupyterLab 3, with enhanced extensions and debugging capabilities.
2. Migration Planning Steps
Assess Current Usage

Identify user groups relying on SageMaker Studio Classic.
Document their workflows, dependencies, and customizations.
Backup and Export Data

Ensure notebooks, datasets, and environment configurations are backed up.
Export Conda environments or dependency lists.
Provision the Latest SageMaker Studio

Set up Domain and User Profiles in the new Studio experience.
Define IAM roles and permissions.
Migrate Custom Jupyter Lab Extensions & Settings

Since you're documenting Jupyter Lab customizations, ensure compatibility with JupyterLab 3.
Validate essential extensions and replace deprecated ones.
Test & Validate

Conduct a pilot migration with select users.
Validate performance, dependencies, and integrations with S3, CodeCommit, GitHub, and other services.
User Training & Documentation

Provide users with guides and training on the new interface.
Update the wiki documentation with migration steps, troubleshooting tips, and new feature highlights.
3. Post-Migration Support
Monitor usage and address user feedback.
Set up a help channel for migration-related questions.
Schedule regular check-ins to resolve issues.
Are there any specific challenges you've encountered in the migration so far?
