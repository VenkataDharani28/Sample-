What is sagemaker poc
ChatGPT said:
A SageMaker Proof of Concept (PoC) is a small-scale implementation designed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of using Amazon SageMaker for a specific machine learning (ML) use case within an organization.

Goals of a SageMaker PoC
Assess Feasibility – Determine if SageMaker meets the requirements for ML development, training, and deployment.
Evaluate Performance – Compare SageMaker's performance with existing solutions or alternative ML platforms.
Understand Costs – Estimate operational costs before a full-scale adoption.
Test Integrations – Ensure compatibility with existing data pipelines, tools, and security policies.
Gain Stakeholder Buy-in – Demonstrate SageMaker’s capabilities to decision-makers and teams.
Typical Steps in a SageMaker PoC
Define Objectives – Identify the problem to solve and key success criteria.
Set Up Environment – Configure SageMaker Studio, instances, and required AWS resources.
Develop & Train Models – Build, train, and optimize a model using SageMaker's built-in algorithms or custom code.
Deploy & Test – Deploy the model using SageMaker endpoints and evaluate predictions.
Measure Success – Compare results against benchmarks and assess business impact.
Document Findings – Summarize insights, challenges, and recommendations for moving forward.
Since you’re planning a SageMaker PoC as part of your migration to the latest SageMaker Studio experience, your focus might be on validating the new Studio features, ensuring smooth integration with EDAP/Bank teams, and optimizing Data Scientist workflows. Would you like help outlining a step-by-step plan?

Can you write the in teraform for 
ChatGPT said:
Yes! If you’re looking to set up an Amazon SageMaker Proof of Concept (PoC) environment using Terraform, you’ll need to create resources like:

SageMaker Studio Domain
User Profiles for Data Scientists
SageMaker Notebook Instances (if needed)
SageMaker Model, Endpoint, and Endpoint Config (for model deployment)
IAM Roles and Policies (for permissions)
Terraform Code for SageMaker PoC Setup
Here’s a Terraform script to set up a basic SageMaker environment with Studio, a notebook instance, and an endpoint for model deployment:

1. Create IAM Role for SageMaker
resource "aws_iam_role" "sagemaker_execution_role" {
  name = "SageMakerExecutionRole"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"
      }
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "sagemaker_full_access" {
  name       = "sagemaker-full-access"
  roles      = [aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.name]
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess"
}
2. Create SageMaker Studio Domain
resource "aws_sagemaker_domain" "sagemaker_studio" {
  domain_name   = "sagemaker-poc-domain"
  auth_mode     = "IAM"
  kms_key_id    = "arn:aws:kms:your-region:your-account-id:key/your-kms-key"
  vpc_id        = "vpc-12345678"
  subnet_ids    = ["subnet-12345678", "subnet-87654321"]
  execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn
  default_user_settings {
    execution_role = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn
  }
}
3. Create a User Profile for SageMaker Studio
resource "aws_sagemaker_user_profile" "data_scientist" {
  domain_id = aws_sagemaker_domain.sagemaker_studio.id
  user_profile_name = "data-scientist-user"
}
4. Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance (If needed)
resource "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance" "poc_notebook" {
  name          = "sagemaker-poc-notebook"
  instance_type = "ml.t3.medium"
  role_arn      = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn
}
5. Create a SageMaker Model (For Deployment Testing)
resource "aws_sagemaker_model" "poc_model" {
  name = "sagemaker-poc-model"

  execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn

  primary_container {
    image = "763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pytorch-inference:1.9.1-cpu-py38"
    model_data_url = "s3://your-model-bucket/model.tar.gz"
  }
}
6. Create a SageMaker Endpoint Configuration & Endpoint
resource "aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration" "poc_endpoint_config" {
  name = "poc-endpoint-config"

  production_variants {
    variant_name           = "poc-variant"
    model_name             = aws_sagemaker_model.poc_model.name
    initial_instance_count = 1
    instance_type          = "ml.m5.large"
  }
}

resource "aws_sagemaker_endpoint" "poc_endpoint" {
  name = "poc-endpoint"
  endpoint_config_name = aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration.poc_endpoint_config.name
}
How to Use This Terraform Code
Save the code into Terraform files (main.tf, iam.tf, etc.).
Run Terraform commands:
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Validate SageMaker setup in the AWS Console.
Next Steps
Customize the IAM role based on security policies.
Use AWS Secrets Manager for secure credentials storage.
Integrate with S3 buckets, EFS, or external data sources.
Would you like me to adjust this for your specific SageMaker PoC migration needs?

You said:
Without user profile and domain can we have?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can use Amazon SageMaker without a SageMaker Studio Domain and User Profile by working with SageMaker Notebook Instances, Training Jobs, Models, and Endpoints directly. This approach is useful if you don't need the interactive development environment of SageMaker Studio and prefer a simpler setup for your PoC.

Terraform Configuration Without Studio Domain & User Profile
This setup includes:
✅ IAM Role for SageMaker
✅ SageMaker Notebook Instance (Optional)
✅ SageMaker Model Deployment
✅ SageMaker Endpoint

1. IAM Role for SageMaker
resource "aws_iam_role" "sagemaker_execution_role" {
  name = "SageMakerExecutionRole"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"
      }
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_policy_attachment" "sagemaker_full_access" {
  name       = "sagemaker-full-access"
  roles      = [aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.name]
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess"
}
2. (Optional) Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance
resource "aws_sagemaker_notebook_instance" "poc_notebook" {
  name          = "sagemaker-poc-notebook"
  instance_type = "ml.t3.medium"
  role_arn      = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn
}
✅ Why use a Notebook Instance?

Run Jupyter-based ML experiments without SageMaker Studio.
Interact with S3 data, train models, and deploy endpoints.
Auto-terminates to save costs.
3. Create a SageMaker Model
resource "aws_sagemaker_model" "poc_model" {
  name = "sagemaker-poc-model"
  execution_role_arn = aws_iam_role.sagemaker_execution_role.arn

  primary_container {
    image          = "763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pytorch-inference:1.9.1-cpu-py38"
    model_data_url = "s3://your-model-bucket/model.tar.gz"
  }
}
4. Create an Endpoint Configuration & Deploy Model
resource "aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration" "poc_endpoint_config" {
  name = "poc-endpoint-config"

  production_variants {
    variant_name           = "poc-variant"
    model_name             = aws_sagemaker_model.poc_model.name
    initial_instance_count = 1
    instance_type          = "ml.m5.large"
  }
}

resource "aws_sagemaker_endpoint" "poc_endpoint" {
  name                 = "poc-endpoint"
  endpoint_config_name = aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration.poc_endpoint_config.name
}
Deployment Steps
1️⃣ Save the Terraform files
2️⃣ Run the following commands:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
3️⃣ Verify Deployment in AWS Console:

Notebook Instances (Optional)
SageMaker Models
SageMaker Endpoints
Can You Use SageMaker Without Studio?
✅ Yes! You can still:

Train models using SageMaker Training Jobs
Deploy models using SageMaker Endpoints
Use S3, Lambda, and API Gateway for ML workloads
Run Jupyter Notebooks on a SageMaker Notebook Instance
Would you like to integrate this with Lambda or API Gateway for inference?
