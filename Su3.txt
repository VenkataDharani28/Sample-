Yes, removing module "sagemaker_domain" and module "sagemaker_looped_users" and keeping only module "sagemaker_app" will significantly change how SageMaker Studio is deployed. Here's what will happen:

Changes & Implications
1. SageMaker Domain Will No Longer Be Managed
What Happens?

SageMaker requires a domain to manage users, storage, and applications.
If you remove module "sagemaker_domain", you will need an existing SageMaker domain created manually or elsewhere in Terraform.
The module "sagemaker_app" depends on a domain (domain_id). Without module "sagemaker_domain", you will need to provide an existing domain ID.
Required Fix:

Instead of creating a domain in Terraform, you can reference an existing domain:
hcl
Copy code
data "aws_sagemaker_domain" "existing_domain" {
  domain_id = "your-existing-domain-id"
}
Then, modify module "sagemaker_app" to use this existing domain:
hcl
Copy code
domain_id = data.aws_sagemaker_domain.existing_domain.id
2. User Profiles Will No Longer Be Managed
What Happens?

Removing module "sagemaker_looped_users" means user profiles won’t be created dynamically.
SageMaker requires user profiles to run Jupyter applications.
The user_profile_name field in module "sagemaker_app" depends on these profiles.
Required Fix:

If profiles already exist, reference them in Terraform:
hcl
Copy code
data "aws_sagemaker_user_profile" "existing_profile" {
  domain_id        = data.aws_sagemaker_domain.existing_domain.id
  user_profile_name = "your-user-profile"
}
Modify module "sagemaker_app" to use this existing profile:
hcl
Copy code
user_profile_name = data.aws_sagemaker_user_profile.existing_profile.user_profile_name
Pros & Cons of This Change
✅ Pros (Why You Might Want This Change)
Simplified Terraform Code – Less complexity if you’re using an existing SageMaker domain and user profiles.
Faster Deployment – If the domain and profiles are pre-configured, app creation will be quicker.
Avoids Unnecessary Resource Creation – Useful if the organization has a centrally managed SageMaker environment.
❌ Cons (Potential Issues)
Manual Domain/User Profile Management Required – You must ensure the domain and user profiles exist before applying Terraform.
Less Automation – New users won’t be automatically provisioned via Terraform.
Potential Inconsistencies – If the domain or profiles change manually, Terraform won’t track them.
Final Recommendation
✅ If you have an existing SageMaker domain and user profiles, you can remove sagemaker_domain and sagemaker_looped_users but must reference them explicitly (as shown in the fixes above).
❌ If you still need to manage domain and users dynamically, keep them in Terraform for full automation.
Would you like me to modify your Terraform code to reflect these changes?
