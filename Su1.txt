Expected Changes in the Migration to the Latest SageMaker Studio Experience
As AWS has deprecated SageMaker Studio Classic, moving to the latest experience will bring several changes in terms of user experience, infrastructure, networking, and IAM permissions. Below are the key expected changes:

1. User Experience Changes
✅ What’s New? (Improvements)
New UI & Navigation: A more modern, intuitive interface with better responsiveness.
Faster Session Start-up: Improved kernel management reduces launch times.
Built-in Git Integration: Users can manage Git branches, commits, and conflicts directly within SageMaker Studio.
Improved Multi-User Support: Better user profile and resource isolation.
Enhanced Notebook Autosave & Recovery: Minimizes work loss from crashes or interruptions.
❌ What’s Changing? (Breaking Changes & Adjustments)
No Support for SageMaker Studio Classic UI – Users must fully transition to the new UI.
Jupyter Classic Interface Removed – Users must work with JupyterLab.
Different Kernel & Image Management – Custom kernel and image configurations need to be validated for compatibility.
Potential IAM & Access Control Changes – Some roles may need adjustments.
2. Infrastructure & Networking Changes
✅ What’s New?
Better VPC & Subnet Handling: More streamlined support for private VPCs.
More Flexible Compute Resources: Dynamic scaling of compute instances.
❌ What’s Changing?
Subnet & Security Group Adjustments: The latest experience may require updates to security groups and subnet configurations.
Potential New VPC Endpoints: Ensure that required AWS services (e.g., S3, ECR, and SageMaker APIs) are accessible.
IAM Role Updates: Certain SageMaker execution policies may need to be modified for compatibility.
3. Terraform Changes in Migration
✅ What Needs to Be Updated?
Terraform Module Versions

Update SageMaker-related Terraform modules to their latest versions.
Validate any breaking changes in module parameters.
IAM Policy Updates

Verify if SageMaker execution roles require additional permissions.
Ensure users have access to the necessary S3 buckets, ECR images, and networking configurations.
Networking Configuration

Validate VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure compatibility.
Add or modify VPC endpoints if needed.
SageMaker Domain & User Profiles

Update the SageMaker Domain module to reflect the latest experience.
Ensure user profiles (module "sagemaker_looped_users") are provisioned correctly.
Application Configuration

Validate image_arn for custom SageMaker images.
Ensure instance_type settings align with the latest supported SageMaker configurations.
Next Steps
Would you like me to draft specific Terraform code updates for this migration?
